# My Digital Garden

Welcome to my personal knowledge base

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage my files, and [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to publish it online on my github.io website

The site is live [here]()

The [index.md](./index.md) contains the home page of my website and links to all the different folders.
