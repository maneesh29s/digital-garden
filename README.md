# My Digital Garden

Welcome to my personal knowledge base

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) to manage my files, and [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to publish it online on my github.io website

Some of the knowledge I have gained as a part of [e4r](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in/clients/engineering-research)

I also write [blogs](https://medium.com/@maneesh29s) derived from some of the notes present in this vault

All the content of this website is present in raw markdown format in [this repo](https://github.com/maneesh29s/digital-garden)

## Contents

1. [AI](./AI)
2. [Algorithms](./Algorithms) 
3. [Computer Architecture](./ComputerArchitecture)

More to be added soon :)
